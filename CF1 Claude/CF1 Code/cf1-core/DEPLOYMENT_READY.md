# Set environment variables
export WALLET_NAME="cf1-deployer"
export CW20_CODE_ID="1"  # Use actual CW20 contract code ID

# Run deployment script
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

### 📋 Expected Deployment Results

**Network:** Neutron Testnet (pion-1)
**RPC:** https://rpc-palvus.pion-1.ntrn.tech
**Contract Size:** 676KB
**Expected Gas:** ~2-3M for instantiation

**Deployment Output:**
```
✅ Contract stored with code ID: [CODE_ID]
✅ Contract instantiated at address: neutron[CONTRACT_ADDRESS]

```

### 🧪 Post-Deployment Testing Plan

1. **Basic Functionality Tests:**
   ```bash
   # Query contract config
   neutrond query wasm contract-state smart [CONTRACT] '{"config":{}}'
   
   # Create test proposal
   neutrond tx wasm execute [CONTRACT] '{
     "create_proposal": {
       "asset_details": {...},
       "financial_terms": {...},
       "documents": [...],
       "compliance": {...}
     }
   }'
   
   # Test investment flow
   neutrond tx wasm execute [CONTRACT] '{
     "invest": {"proposal_id": "test-001"}
   }' --amount 1000000untrn
   ```

2. **Advanced Feature Tests:**
   - Multi-asset portfolio creation
