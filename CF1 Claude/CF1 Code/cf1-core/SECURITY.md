# CF1 Launchpad Security Analysis

## Security Architecture Overview

The CF1 Launchpad smart contract implements a comprehensive security framework designed to protect users' funds and maintain platform integrity. This document outlines the security measures, potential risks, and mitigation strategies.

## Core Security Principles

### 1. Defense in Depth
- Multiple layers of security controls
- Input validation at every entry point
- Access control enforcement
- Mathematical overflow protection
- Rate limiting and anti-spam measures

### 2. Principle of Least Privilege
- Role-based access control (Admin, Creator, Investor)
- Function-specific permissions
- Time-bound access where applicable

### 3. Fail-Safe Defaults
- Conservative default settings
- Automatic refunds for failed proposals
- Lockup period enforcement
- Platform fee caps

## Security Features Implemented

### Access Control
```rust
// Admin-only functions
- update_config()
- emergency_pause()
- force_refund()

// Creator-only functions  
- update_proposal() (own proposals only)
- cancel_proposal() (own proposals only)

// Time-based restrictions
- Investment window enforcement
- Lockup period validation
- Funding deadline checks
```

### Input Validation
```rust
// Comprehensive validation in security.rs
- Asset name length (1-100 characters)
- Target amount > 0
- Token price > 0
- Funding deadline validation (7-120 days)
- Investment amount limits
- String sanitization for XSS protection
```

### Mathematical Safety
```rust
// Overflow/underflow protection
- Checked arithmetic operations
- Safe percentage calculations
- Division by zero protection
- Precision handling for financial calculations
```

### Fund Protection
```rust
// Escrow and refund mechanisms
- Native coin escrow until funding completion
- Automatic refunds for failed proposals
- Platform fee deduction only on success
- No token minting until funding goal reached
```

## Risk Assessment Matrix

| Risk Category | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|---------------|------------|--------|------------|--------|
| **Fund Loss** | Low | Critical | Escrow system, tested refund logic | ✅ Mitigated |
| **Unauthorized Access** | Low | High | Role-based access control | ✅ Mitigated |
| **Integer Overflow** | Low | High | Checked arithmetic throughout | ✅ Mitigated |
| **Reentrancy** | Very Low | High | CosmWasm execution model protection | ✅ Mitigated |
| **Input Manipulation** | Medium | Medium | Comprehensive input validation | ✅ Mitigated |
| **Spam/DoS** | Medium | Low | Rate limiting, gas optimization | ✅ Mitigated |
| **Front-running** | Low | Medium | Blockchain-native issue, minimal impact | ⚠️ Monitored |
| **Oracle Manipulation** | N/A | N/A | No external oracles used | ✅ N/A |

## Security Controls Detail

### 1. Access Control Matrix

| Function | Admin | Creator | Investor | Public |
|----------|-------|---------|----------|--------|
| create_proposal | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| update_proposal | ✅ | ✅ (own) | ❌ | ❌ |
| cancel_proposal | ✅ | ✅ (own) | ❌ | ❌ |
| invest | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| mint_tokens | ✅ | ✅ (own) | ❌ | ❌ |
| distribute_tokens | ✅ | ✅ (own) | ❌ | ❌ |
| refund_investors | ✅ | ✅ (own) | ❌ | ❌ |
| update_config | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

### 2. Financial Controls

```rust
// Platform fee limits
const MAX_PLATFORM_FEE_BPS: u16 = 1000; // 10% maximum

// Investment limits (configurable)
const MIN_INVESTMENT: Uint128 = Uint128::new(1_000_000); // 1 NTRN
const MAX_INVESTMENT: Uint128 = Uint128::new(1_000_000_000_000); // 1M NTRN

// Funding period limits
const MIN_FUNDING_PERIOD: u64 = 7 * 24 * 60 * 60; // 7 days
const MAX_FUNDING_PERIOD: u64 = 120 * 24 * 60 * 60; // 120 days

// Lockup period (non-negotiable)
const LOCKUP_PERIOD: u64 = 365 * 24 * 60 * 60; // 12 months
```

### 3. State Validation

```rust
// Proposal state machine validation
Active -> Funded -> TokensMinted -> TokensDistributed -> Completed
     \-> Cancelled
     \-> Failed

// Investment state validation
Pending -> Confirmed -> Refunded/TokensReceived

// Temporal validation
- Funding deadline enforcement
- Lockup period enforcement
- State transition timing
```

## Known Attack Vectors & Mitigation

### 1. Economic Attacks

**Flash Loan Attacks**
- **Risk**: Not applicable (no lending/borrowing)
- **Mitigation**: N/A

**Sandwich Attacks**
- **Risk**: Low (fixed-price tokens, no AMM)
- **Mitigation**: Fixed pricing eliminates arbitrage opportunities

**Pump and Dump**
- **Risk**: Medium (market manipulation post-launch)
- **Mitigation**: 12-month lockup period, compliance tracking

### 2. Technical Attacks

**Reentrancy**
- **Risk**: Very Low (CosmWasm execution model)
- **Mitigation**: Built-in CosmWasm protection + explicit checks

**Integer Overflow/Underflow**
- **Risk**: Low
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive checked arithmetic in `MathGuard`

**Storage Exhaustion**
- **Risk**: Low
- **Mitigation**: Pagination, gas limits, storage optimization

**Front-running**
- **Risk**: Low (limited MEV opportunities)
- **Mitigation**: Fixed pricing, first-come-first-serve basis

### 3. Governance Attacks

**Admin Key Compromise**
- **Risk**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Multi-sig recommended, limited admin powers

**Proposal Manipulation**
- **Risk**: Low
- **Mitigation**: Creator-only updates, immutable core terms
