# CF1 Platform - Development Guide

CF1 is an enterprise-grade blockchain platform for Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization, featuring launchpad, governance, marketplace, and compliance modules. Built with quality over speed, targeting enterprise adoption with U.S. Reg CF compliance.

## Developer Preferences & Notifications

**User Notification Preference**: Terminal bell sound (`echo -e "\a"`) should be used:
- At the end of every response/request completion
- When permission questions arise that require user input
- When awaiting user decision or action

This helps ensure the user is notified when their attention is needed during development work.

## Core Mission & Philosophy

**Mission**: Create a regulated RWA tokenization ecosystem with institutional-grade UX that abstracts blockchain complexity while maintaining DeFi benefits.

**User Experience**: "TradFi Feel, DeFi Engine"
- Clean, professional UI resembling institutional investment platforms
- Abstracted wallet interactions through CF1 UI only
- Frictionless onboarding - wallet connection only required for first investment
- No direct on-chain transfers outside platform rules
