## 🔧 **Troubleshooting Guide**

### **Authentication Issues**:
1. **Password with special characters not working**:
   - Ensure proper JSON escaping in API calls
   - Use double quotes in curl commands: `"BrianCF1Admin2025!"`
   - Check browser network tab for actual request format

2. **Admin users not visible in UI**:
   - Verify admin login is successful (check browser console)
   - Check API call to `/api/admin/users` in network tab
   - Ensure admin JWT token is included in Authorization header

3. **"Authorization denied" errors**:
   - Check that admin routes are mounted before server-side authorization
   - Verify JWT token is valid and not expired
   - Check user has super_admin role and proper permissions

### **Deployment Issues**:
1. **Railway deployment fails**:
   - Run `railway logs` to check build errors
   - Ensure all environment variables are set
   - Check `railway status` for current deployment status

2. **Netlify build fails**:
   - Run `netlify logs` to check build errors
   - Verify all dependencies are installed
   - Check TypeScript compilation errors

### **Common Commands**:
```bash
# Check deployment status
railway status
netlify status

# Deploy both frontend and backend
cd backend && railway up --detach
cd .. && netlify deploy --prod

# Check recent logs
railway logs
netlify logs

# Test API endpoints
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  https://cf1-claude-production.up.railway.app/api/admin/users
```

## 🎯 **Next Development Priorities**
