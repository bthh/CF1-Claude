# Portfolio Instant Funding Fix

## Issue Identified
After instant funding on launchpad proposals, investments are not showing in portfolio assets.

## Root Cause Found
The ProposalDetail component was trying to access `address` directly from `useWalletStore()`, but the wallet store structure has the address nested as `connection.address`.

## Fix Applied

### 1. **Fixed Wallet Address Access** (`ProposalDetail.tsx`)
```javascript
// Before (incorrect):
const { address } = useWalletStore();

// After (correct):
const { connection } = useWalletStore();
const address = connection?.address;
```

### 2. **Added Fallback for Admin Users**
Admin users performing instant funding may not have a connected wallet, so added a fallback:
```javascript
const effectiveAddress = address || 'neutron1admin_instant_fund_address';
```

### 3. **Enhanced Debugging**
Added comprehensive logging to track the portfolio update process:
- Wallet connection status
- Transaction data being added
- Portfolio state verification
- Development asset generation

## Expected Flow Now

1. **Admin clicks "Instant Fund"** on a proposal
2. **Backend API call** succeeds and updates proposal status
3. **Frontend gets wallet address** (from connection or fallback)
4. **Transaction added to portfolio store** with:
   - Type: 'investment'
   - Asset ID: proposal ID
   - Asset Name: proposal name
   - Amount: funded amount
   - Shares: calculated based on amount
   - Status: 'completed'
5. **Portfolio data service** reads transactions and generates assets
6. **Portfolio displays** the new investment

## Testing Steps

1. Go to a launchpad proposal detail page
2. Click "Instant Fund" (admin role required)
3. Check browser console for debugging logs
4. Navigate to Portfolio page
5. Verify the funded asset appears in "My Assets"

## Files Modified
- `ProposalDetail.tsx` - Fixed wallet address access and added fallback

## Debug Information to Check
Look for these console logs:
- `üîç Debug - Wallet connection:` - Shows connection object
- `üîç Debug - Wallet address:` - Shows extracted address
- `üìä Portfolio transaction data added:` - Shows transaction details
- `üîç Debug - Portfolio state after adding:` - Shows updated transactions
- `üîç Debug - Development assets after instant fund:` - Shows portfolio assets

If the investment still doesn't appear, check:
1. Is the wallet connected or using fallback address?
2. Are transactions being added to portfolio store?
3. Is the portfolio data service correctly processing transactions into assets?
4. Is the Portfolio page in the correct data mode (development)?
