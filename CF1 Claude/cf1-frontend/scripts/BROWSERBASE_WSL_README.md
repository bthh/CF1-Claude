# Browserbase Integration - WSL Networking Issues

## Problem Summary

**Issue**: WebSocket connections to Browserbase timeout consistently in WSL environment
**Root Cause**: WSL networking restrictions prevent WebSocket (`wss://`) connections to external services
**Confirmed Working**: HTTP requests work fine (tested with `curl`)
**Impact**: UI visual analysis workflow blocked in current development environment

## Testing Results

### ✅ What Works
- HTTP connectivity to Browserbase: `curl -I https://connect.browserbase.com` returns 401 (expected)
- Script architecture and error handling is correct
- Browserbase credentials are valid
- Both local HTML injection and production URL approaches are properly implemented

### ❌ What Fails
- WebSocket connection: `browserType.connect()` times out after 30-60 seconds
- Affects all scripts: `connect_test.cjs`, `production_test.cjs`, `browserbase-diagnostic.js`
- Same error regardless of timeout values (10s, 30s, 60s tested)

## Error Details

```
Error Type: Error
Error Message: browserType.connect: Timeout 45000ms exceeded
```

**Technical Analysis**:
- Playwright's `chromium.connect()` uses WebSocket protocol to control remote browser
- WSL has known limitations with WebSocket connections to external services
- This is an environment-specific limitation, not a code issue

## Workaround Solutions

### Option 1: Use Different Development Environment ✅ **RECOMMENDED**
Run the Browserbase scripts on:
- **Native Windows** with Node.js installed
- **macOS** or **Linux** (non-WSL)
- **GitHub Codespaces** with forwarded ports
- **Docker container** with proper network configuration

### Option 2: Manual UI Analysis (Current Approach)
Instead of automated screenshots, use:
- **WebFetch** tool to analyze production site content
- **Manual review** of UI components in browser
- **Static analysis** of React components and CSS

### Option 3: Alternative Screenshot Services
Replace Browserbase with WSL-compatible alternatives:
- **Puppeteer** with local Chrome installation (if available)
- **Screenshot APIs** that work via HTTP requests
- **Headless Chrome** in Docker container

## Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Test HTTP connectivity (should work)
curl -I https://connect.browserbase.com

# Test WebSocket connection (will timeout in WSL)
node scripts/connect_test.cjs

# Test with production URL (will also timeout in WSL)
node scripts/production_test.cjs
```

## Development Recommendation

**For immediate UI analysis**: Use manual browser inspection of https://rwa2.netlify.app/

**For future development**: Consider setting up Browserbase testing in a non-WSL environment where WebSocket connections work properly.

## Scripts Ready for Deployment

All Browserbase integration scripts are complete and will work immediately when moved to a compatible environment:

1. **`connect_test.cjs`** - Basic connection validation
2. **`production_test.cjs`** - Full CF1 site analysis with multiple pages
3. **`browserbase-diagnostic.js`** - Comprehensive diagnostic testing
4. **`refine_v2.js`** - UI refinement workflow with Claude analysis

The code architecture is sound and the integration will work once WebSocket connectivity is available.
