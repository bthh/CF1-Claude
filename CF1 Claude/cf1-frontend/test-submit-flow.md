## Testing Instructions

1. **Navigate to Create Proposal page**
   - Go to `/launchpad/create`

2. **Fill out the form completely**
   - Complete steps 1-4 with valid data

3. **Test Save Draft functionality**
   - Click "Save as Draft" button
   - Verify it saves without confirmation modal
   - Verify success message mentions draft saving

4. **Test Submit Proposal functionality**
   - Click "Submit Proposal for Review" button
   - Verify confirmation modal appears
   - Check modal content explains the review process
   - Cancel to test modal dismissal
   - Click again and confirm submission
   - Verify loading state shows "Submitting..."
   - Verify success message says "Proposal Successfully Submitted!"
   - Verify navigation to /my-submissions

5. **Test Edge Cases**
   - Try submitting incomplete form (should show validation errors)
   - Test with network issues (should fallback gracefully)
   - Test double-click prevention during submission

## Expected Behavior

- **BEFORE**: Button said "Submit Proposal" but appeared to save as draft
- **AFTER**: Button clearly says "Submit Proposal for Review" with confirmation dialog
- Users now understand the difference between drafting and submitting
- Clear feedback during and after submission process
- Proper loading states prevent user confusion
