# CF1 Real-Time Event Streaming Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the real-time event streaming architecture for the CF1 platform, designed to provide instant updates for all blockchain events, user actions, and market data.

## Architecture Components

### 1. WebSocket Gateway
- **Purpose**: Central hub for all real-time connections
- **Technology**: Node.js with Socket.io for broad client support
- **Features**:
  - Auto-reconnection with exponential backoff
  - Heartbeat monitoring
  - Connection pooling
  - Load balancing across multiple instances

### 2. Event Aggregation Layer
- **Purpose**: Collect and normalize events from multiple sources
- **Components**:
  - Blockchain Event Listener (CosmWasm event indexer)
  - User Action Stream (Frontend events)
  - Market Data Feed (Price updates, volume changes)
  - System Events (Governance proposals, announcements)

### 3. Event Processing Pipeline
```
Blockchain Events → Event Parser → Event Enricher → Event Router → Client Delivery
                         ↓              ↓              ↓
                    Validation     Add Context    Topic Routing
```

### 4. State Synchronization Engine
- **Conflict Resolution Strategy**: Last-Write-Wins with vector clocks
- **State Snapshot**: Periodic full state snapshots for new connections
- **Delta Updates**: Incremental updates for existing connections
- **Reconciliation**: Client-side state reconciliation on reconnect

### 5. Event Types & Topics

```typescript
enum EventType {
  // Blockchain Events
  PROPOSAL_CREATED = 'proposal.created',
  PROPOSAL_UPDATED = 'proposal.updated',
  INVESTMENT_MADE = 'investment.made',
  TOKEN_MINTED = 'token.minted',
  LOCKUP_RELEASED = 'lockup.released',
  
  // Market Events
  PRICE_UPDATE = 'market.price',
  VOLUME_UPDATE = 'market.volume',
  LIQUIDITY_CHANGE = 'market.liquidity',
  
  // Governance Events
  VOTE_CAST = 'governance.vote',
  PROPOSAL_EXECUTED = 'governance.executed',
  
  // System Events
  MAINTENANCE_ALERT = 'system.maintenance',
  RATE_LIMIT_WARNING = 'system.ratelimit'
}
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1)
1. Set up WebSocket gateway server
2. Implement connection management
3. Create event type system
4. Build basic pub/sub routing

### Phase 2: Blockchain Integration (Week 2)
1. Create CosmWasm event indexer
2. Implement event parsing and enrichment
3. Build event aggregation service
4. Connect to existing React Query cache

### Phase 3: State Management (Week 3)
1. Implement conflict resolution algorithms
2. Build state snapshot system
3. Create delta update mechanism
4. Add client reconciliation logic

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Week 4)
1. Implement event replay system
2. Add filtering and subscription management
3. Build performance monitoring
4. Create fallback mechanisms

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: JWT-based WebSocket authentication
2. **Authorization**: Topic-based access control
3. **Rate Limiting**: Per-connection event limits
4. **Encryption**: TLS for all WebSocket connections
5. **Validation**: Event payload validation before broadcast

## Performance Targets

- **Latency**: < 100ms from blockchain event to client delivery
- **Throughput**: 10,000 concurrent connections per gateway instance
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with automatic failover
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling with Redis pub/sub

## Client Integration

```typescript
// Example client usage
const eventStream = new CF1EventStream({
  url: 'wss://events.cf1platform.com',
  auth: { token: userJWT },
  topics: ['proposal.*', 'market.price.CF1-001'],
  onEvent: (event) => {
    // Update React Query cache
    // Update Zustand stores
    // Trigger UI updates
  },
  onReconnect: async () => {
    // Reconcile state
    // Replay missed events
  }
});
```

## Monitoring & Observability

1. **Metrics**:
   - Connection count
   - Event throughput
   - Latency percentiles
   - Error rates

2. **Logging**:
   - Connection lifecycle
   - Event flow tracing
   - Error debugging

3. **Alerts**:
   - High latency warnings
   - Connection storm detection
   - Event queue backup

## Next Steps

1. Set up development environment for WebSocket server
2. Create proof-of-concept with basic events
3. Integrate with existing CF1 infrastructure
4. Load test with simulated clients
