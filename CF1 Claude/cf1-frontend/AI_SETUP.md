## Rate Limits & Usage

**Free Tier Limits:**

- Perfect for development and testing

**Fallback Behavior:**

- If rate limit exceeded → Shows countdown timer
- If API fails → Graceful degradation to improved mock responses

## Testing Tips

1. **Start with simple requests** to verify the integration
2. **Monitor the browser console** for API status messages
3. **Try different features** to test various AI prompts
4. **Test rate limiting** by making rapid requests

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **"API key not configured"** → Check your `.env.local` file
2. **"Rate limit exceeded"** → Wait for the cooldown period
3. **Slow responses** → Normal for AI processing, usually 2-5 seconds
4. **Generic responses** → API might be down, using fallback mode

### Debug Steps:
1. Check browser console for detailed error messages
2. Verify API key is correctly set in environment
3. Test with a simple asset analysis first
4. Ensure good internet connection for API calls

## Next Steps

Once the free tier integration is working well, we can:
1. **Upgrade to paid tier** for higher limits
2. **Add response caching** to reduce API calls
3. **Implement request queuing** for better UX
4. **Add more specialized prompts** for different use cases
