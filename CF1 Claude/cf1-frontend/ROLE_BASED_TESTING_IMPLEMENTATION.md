## üîß **Key Technical Features**

### **Role-Based Data Management**
```typescript
// Automatic data seeding for any role
const data = roleBasedDemoData.switchToRole('investor', 'sales_demo');

// Role-specific data generation
const investorData = {
  portfolio: { assets: [...], summary: {...} },
  recommendations: [...],
  governance: [...],
  transactions: [...],
  analytics: {...}
};
```

### **Scenario-Based Testing**
```typescript
const testingScenarios = [
  {
    id: 'investment_flow',
    name: 'Complete Investment Flow',
    roles: ['investor'],
    objectives: [
      'Browse and filter available proposals',
      'Complete investment process',
      'Track portfolio performance'
    ]
  }
];
```

### **Hybrid Mode Configuration**
```typescript
const hybridConfig = {
  useRealTransactions: false,
  useRealBalances: false,
  useRealProposals: false,
  enableRealTimeSync: false,
  simulateNetworkDelay: true
};
```
