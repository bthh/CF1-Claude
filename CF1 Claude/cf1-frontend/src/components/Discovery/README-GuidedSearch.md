# Guided Search Questions Feature

### State Management
The guided search state is managed in `discoveryStore.ts`:
```typescript
interface GuidedSearchState {
  isActive: boolean;
  category: string;
  originalQuery: string;
  answers: GuidedAnswer[];
  showAfterResultCount?: number;
  showAfterSeconds?: number;
}
```

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Real Estate + AirBnB Search
```
1. Select "Real Estate" category
2. Search "airbnb investment"  
3. Guided search triggers (low results)
4. Answer questions:
   - Location: "Vacation Destinations"
   - Property Type: "Hospitality (Hotels/AirBnB)"  
   - Budget: $100K - $500K
   - Timeline: "Medium-term (3-5 years)"
   - Features: "High Cash Flow", "Passive Income"
5. Enhanced results show AirBnB-specific opportunities
```

### Scenario 2: Technology + AI Search  
```
1. Select "Technology" category
2. Search "AI startup investment"
3. Guided search triggers
4. Answer questions:
   - Industry: "Artificial Intelligence"
   - Stage: "Early Stage (Seed/Series A)"
   - Market: "Global"  
   - Focus: "B2B Solutions"
5. Enhanced results prioritize AI B2B startups
```

### Scenario 3: No Results Trigger
```
1. Select "Collectibles" category  
2. Search "rare baseball cards"
3. No results found - immediate guided search suggestion
4. Complete sports memorabilia questions
5. Mock enhanced results for sports card investing
```

## Implementation Details

### Question Types
- **Multiple Choice**: Checkbox-style with multiple selections
- **Range Slider**: Min/max values with currency/unit formatting  
- **Text Input**: Free-form text entry with placeholder
- **Single Choice**: Radio-style single selection (future enhancement)

### Enhancement Algorithm
The `GuidedSearchEnhancer` applies category-specific logic:
- Keyword matching between answers and content
- Relevance score boosting (0.0 - 0.4 bonus)
- Mock result generation for sparse original results
- Reason generation explaining relevance matches

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading of question components
- Debounced search with timeout management
- Memoized search results and handlers
- Efficient state updates in Zustand store

## Future Enhancements

1. **Machine Learning Integration**: Use actual ML models for result ranking
2. **Answer Persistence**: Remember user preferences across sessions
3. **Advanced Question Types**: Date pickers, multi-range sliders, conditional questions
4. **Analytics**: Track question completion rates and result satisfaction
5. **A/B Testing**: Test different question flows and trigger conditions
6. **Integration**: Connect with real search APIs and content databases

## Configuration

The guided search can be configured via the discoveryStore:
```typescript
// Trigger after 2 results instead of 3
startGuidedSearch(category, query, { showAfterResultCount: 2 });

// Trigger after 5 seconds instead of 3  
startGuidedSearch(category, query, { showAfterSeconds: 5000 });
```
